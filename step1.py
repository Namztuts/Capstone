#Initial Project Ideas

'''
- write a short blurb explaining each idea; at a high level, describe the problem and the data i would use to solve it | highlight which one i would most like

Calendar app | Google Calendar API
A "simple" calendar app that allows users to create/edit/view their calendar and events on a day/week/month view
A Login ability and the ability to export to Google calendar would be great additions

Movie app | OMDb API | others will be needed more than likely
Where it shows which streaming service has which movie
Login to allow bookmarked movies/shows
When researching, a challenge might be APIs limiting how many searches | suggested looking into caching | could limit results to a few?

E-commerce app | FakeStore API
Allow users to browse products and add to their shopping cart
